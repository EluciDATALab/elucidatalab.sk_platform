<p><span style="color:#4b4b4b">Programming is for men! With&nbsp;roughly 23 %<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;female workers in the IT sector in Belgium, this assumption seems to suggest itself. And still, the first person ever regarded to be a programmer was a woman – namely&nbsp;Ada Lovelace&nbsp;back in 1843.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#4b4b4b">Supported by her mother – in her opinion to prevent her&nbsp;from developing her father's&nbsp;(Lord Byron)&nbsp;perceived insanity&nbsp;– she eagerly studied mathematics and logic. When meeting Charles Babbage and learning about his Analytical Engine she was enthusiastic about the idea of a machine that&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#4b4b4b">“has no pretensions whatever to originate&nbsp;anything. It can do whatever we know how&nbsp;to order it  to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.”</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#4b4b4b">Not only that she developed a method for calculating the Bernoulli number on the Analytical Engine (considered the first&nbsp;published algorithm ever, but&nbsp;unfortunately never built), it was her driving the work and believing in it. That given, she was not only a talented mathematician but also a visioner and innovation driver.&nbsp;And&nbsp;most importantly, recognized&nbsp;as such&nbsp;by others (amongst them many&nbsp;men) in a time and age&nbsp;when&nbsp;women were&nbsp;still seen&nbsp;as just a&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;adornment of&nbsp;the décor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#4b4b4b">On the international day of women in mathematics, we are happy to announce the birth of a new blog series, namely the SirAdas blog. Its mission is to spread and promote achievements of women passionate about science, technology and innovation. In other words, the modern Ada Lovelaces.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#4b4b4b">Let’s celebrate and cherish women’s&nbsp;intelligence and creativity!&nbsp;Follow&nbsp;and contribute to&nbsp;our blog!&nbsp;</span></p>
